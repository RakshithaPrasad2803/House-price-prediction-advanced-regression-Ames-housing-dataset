Predicting house prices is an important task in the field of real estate and finance. Accurate predictions help stakeholders such as homebuyers, sellers, real estate agents, and investors make informed decisions. However, predicting house prices is complex due to the diverse set of features that influence property values. These features range from physical characteristics of the house, like size and condition, to location-based factors, such as neighborhood and accessibility to amenities.

In this project, we aimed to build machine learning models to predict house prices using advanced regression techniques. We trained and evaluated four different models: Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting, and Lasso Regression. Through this, we explored the effectiveness of each model in predicting house prices and optimized their performance through hyperparameter tuning.

**About Dataset**

We are using the "Ames Housing dataset" which was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education. It's a great alternative for a modernized and expanded version of the often cited Boston Housing dataset. 

This dataset contains 79 explanatory variables describing various aspects of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.
